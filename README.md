# ArchiveJump

> A simple browser extension that helps you access archived versions of articles when paywalls get in the way of learning, research, and staying informed.

## Why I Built This

Sometimes you hit a paywall when researching for school, fact-checking information, or trying to understand different perspectives on current events. Maybe you've already reached your monthly limit, or you're exploring whether a publication is worth subscribing to.

ArchiveJump helps in these moments by connecting you to archived versions that already exist on the public web. It's not about circumventing protections‚Äîit's about making it easier to find content that's already been preserved by legitimate archival services.

## ‚ú® What It Does

**Three ways to access archives:**

1. **Auto-redirect** - Click any article link from supported sites and get redirected to Archive.ph automatically
2. **Context menu** - Right-click any link and select "View archived link" 
3. **Manual search** - Click the extension icon to search the current page

**Smart features:**
- Only redirects actual article links, not homepages or category pages
- Searches Archive.ph first, falls back to Wayback Machine if needed
- Choose between search page or direct latest archive access
- Visual feedback shows what's happening
- Works entirely locally - no data collection

## üíô A Note on Ethics

Quality journalism costs money, and I respect that. Publishers need to sustain their operations and pay their journalists.

ArchiveJump connects you to content that's already been archived by public archival services. If you regularly read a publication, please consider subscribing to support their work. This tool is best used for occasional research, fact-checking, or exploring new publications‚Äînot as a replacement for supporting journalism you value.
